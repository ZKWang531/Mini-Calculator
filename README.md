# Mini-Calculator
This project aims to interface and program Tiva C Series TM4C123GH6PM microcontroller by C, a 16-fonts x 2-line SPLC780D LCD and a 4x4 keypad each through hardware and Keil uVision software.
Implemented dynamic equation graphing, floating-point arithmetic, number base conversions, and equation solving.
Designed a modular system architecture with independent input processing, computation, and display control modules.
Utilized CGRAM for custom LCD characters, enabling real-time graph to generate with axis markers.
